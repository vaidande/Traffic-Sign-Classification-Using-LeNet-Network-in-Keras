# Traffic-Sign-Classification-Using-LeNet-Network-in-Keras

A Basic Deep Learning Project using Keras as Tensorflow Backend                   

This Simple Project is the foundation of Self-Driving Cars.

1> In this Project, we have been provided with images of traffic signs and the goal is to train a Deep Network to classify them.          
2> The dataset contains 43 different classes of images.                
3> The Network used is called Le-Net which is a part of Convolutional Neural Networks.                     

To Predict : The Type/Class of Traffic Sign Provided
